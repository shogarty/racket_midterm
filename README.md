# racket_midterm
This is the code I wrote for a midterm in college, saved for posterity. The midterm was written in Racket, and followed what I refer to as a "hackathon-style midterm". We were given exactly 24 hours to complete the test, from 1PM on March 25th, 2022, to 1PM on the following day. We were allowed to use any resources available to us, including the internet and any notes and labs from the class. The one restriction is that we weren't allowed to collaborate or ask anyone else for help, and all our code had to be our own.

I managed to complete the exam shortly after midnight after working for about eight hours on it, and recieved a perfect score. Many of my classmates used the full 24 hours and were unable to finish. The exam is broken into three sections. The first deals with recursion and lists, the second with higher-order functions, and the third with interpreters. For the third section an partial interpreter was provided with the source code but I chose to delete it and replace it with the one I wrote for the previous lab, as I believed it may have some functions that would prove useful. Rotate was also a function from a previous lab that I brought in as I believed it would prove useful. Currently the exam does not have much in the way of comments, as it was written under time pressure. I have chosen to leave it as such as so to preseve the form in which it was turned in.
